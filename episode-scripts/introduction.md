Hi. I'm Stuart P. Bentley. I explain the internet.

I know you're smart and your time is valuable, so I'm going to go through this as fast as I can. You can backtrack or leave questions in the comments.

I'm updating these videos constantly, so if you know anything I've messed up, leave a comment here or, better, file an issue on GitHub, and I'll address it in the next version.

If these videos helped you learn, subscribe for more, and maybe donate?
